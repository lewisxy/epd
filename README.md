# EPD - Encrypted Password Database

EPD is a tool to archive personal credentials (mostly passwords) and 
store them safely in file. It is designed to be secure, lightweighted, 
portable, and convenient. 

Supported platform: Windows (Mingw/MSVC), *nix (tested on Linux)

> NOTE AND UPDATE: This software is still under development. Minor changes 
may be applied to the file structures and functionalities. Backward 
capability is not garuenteed.

> WARNING: This tool is not approved by any authorities on data security
or cryptography. The author of this software is not an expert in security 
related fields. Please be informed that any use of this software is at users
own risk and the author is not responsible for any property or data losses.

## Installation

EPD provides no installation by itself as it emphasizes portability. The 
below instruction covers only the building process. The resulted binary will
be in `build` directory.

### Windows

There is two ways to build on Windows. If you can either build with Mingw or
MSVC. Building with Mingw requires the installation of 
[Mingw-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/). Building
with MSVC requires the installation of Visual Studio Build Tool. This tool is
installed automatically if you have installed any version of Visual Studio.
If you don't want to install Visual Studio, please see 
[this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f35ctcxw.aspx) one.

#### Mingw

Open a command prompt with all necessary environmental variables set (for
example, put the Mingw installation path in `path` variable), redirect to
the project directory, and use the below command.

    $ make -f Makefile.mingw epd
    
#### MSVC

Open the Visual Studio Build Tool command prompt, see 
[this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f35ctcxw.aspx), redirect to 
the project directory and use the below command.

    $ nmake -f Makefile.win epd
    
### Linux (and Unix, untested)

Open the terminal and redirect to the project directory. Use below command.

    $ make -f Makefile.nix epd
    
## Usage

The brief documentation is located in `doc.h`, which will be printed out
if you run the binary with `-h`. Full documentation is not yet finished.

## File Structure

EPD will create two kinds of file, the key file and the database file.
The key file is generated by `keygen` command and is required for all the
database operation (feed in by `-k` option). The database file will ends with
`.edb` and contains the data.

### Key file

```
[Public Key (32)][Secret key* (64)][Signature (64)]
```

*The secret key is 32 bytes long by itself, and there are some addtional 
information (iv, protective hash). The total length is 64 bytes.

### Database file

The database structure is slightly complicated.

```
[IV][Ephermeral Public Key][ENC 1][Checksum 1][ENC 2][Checksum 2]
```

IV is 8 bytes, Keys are 32 bytes, Checksums are 32 bytes.

ENC 1 is the block of header, index, and tags.

ENC 2 is the block of data.

## NOTE

1. Though the author has limited expertise in developing this kind of software,
the security model should work and may be redudent. This may affect the 
performance of this software. It is normal for it to take several seconds to 
complete one operation (without compiler optimization).

2. There may be some minor issues/bugs of this software, since there is not 
enough tests to prove its robostness. It is welcome to test this program and 
provide issues/bug reports and suggestions for further improvements.

## Special thanks

This program is largely inspired by 
[skeeto/enchive](https://github.com/skeeto/enchive), which provides the data 
securitycmodel for this program. The `ed.c` is a amalgamation of 
[kc1212/ref10_extract](https://github.com/kc1212/ref10_extract), which 
provides the functionality of ed25519 signature using Curve25519 key pairs.
